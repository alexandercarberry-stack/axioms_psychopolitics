# Enter at Your Peril: The Political Theatre and The Axioms of Psychopolitics

**By Alexander Carberry**

---

Psychopolitics concerns the symbolic and libidinal structuring of human relationality under the conditions of governance, recognition, rejection, and power.

It speaks from and to the field where fantasy, subjectivity, and power are constituted and contested between human beings through symbolic regimes.

While centred on the intersubjective field, the structuring dynamics of psychopolitics are scalable to relationality between states—revealing how nations and institutions inherit, project, and defend fantasmatic positions within the geopolitical Symbolic.

## Axiom 1 — Politics as the Libidinal Mediation of Fantasmatic Relations

Politics is the libidinal mediation of fantasmatic relations.

That is: political structures, actions, and identities are not grounded in rational calculation or material necessity alone, but in the generation, defence, transmission, and disruption of fantasies that organise the Symbolic order.

These fantasies mediate the subject's relation to the Other, to power, and to the Real—and are sustained through libidinal investments in coherence, exclusion, and identity.

---

## Axiom 2 — The Political Subject as Split Aggregate

The political subject is not comprised as a singular, coherent self, but is rather a structural aggregate composed of multiple individual selves—each produced through distinct symbolic positions, historical inheritances, and libidinal investments.

This aggregation does not result in unity, but in structural split.

The political subject exists only by binding these selves into a fantasmatic coherence—a coherence that masks the contradiction, exclusion, and foreclosure which structures the political field.

To act politically is to endure this structural split and yet symbolise within this internal multiplicity often with the coherence of identity as defence.

### Axiom 2.1 — On the Fetish and the Fantasy of Coherence

This axiom reveals the mechanism by which The Fantasy Political Aggregate sustains itself.

The Fantasy Political Aggregate is formed from structurally split subjects therefore its composition built upon constitutive lack experienced as contradiction.

The fantasy of coherence masks this contradiction, by employing a necessary fetish. This is the function of the Master Signifier, who emerges to retroactively unify and stabilise the field, through ongoing stabilisation labour.

The fetish sutures the contradiction symbolically without resolution, enabling libidinal investment to circulate despite the absence of unified desire.

This fetish functions as the screen upon which the Aggregate projects its imagined wholeness.

### Axiom 2.2 — On Anxiety, Disaggregation, and the Revelation of the Fetish

This axiom names the libidinal cost of the symbolic construction.

The Fantasy Political Aggregate is dominated by a latent inescapable anxiety that it will disaggregate.

This anxiety arises from the subjects knowing that the fetish is mere substitution, to suture their lack, and that the constituent individual selves will come to affirm their existential structural alienation.

This anxiety governs the Aggregate's symbolic policing, its demand for loyalty, and its violent defence of fantasy. This inevitably subjects the political field to carceral logic.

The more incoherent the Aggregate becomes, the more fanatically it clings to and enacts the fetish.

The fetish as spectacle is not mere distraction—it is political jouissance: the libidinal excess that binds the aggregate to its fantasy of coherence, transforming contradiction into shared enjoyment.

It is through jouissance that the aggregate remains loyal to its own disavowal.

### Axiom 2.3 — On the Political as Libidinal Theatre

Politics is libidinal theatre, governing material necessity and rational deliberation.

It is the stage where the collective coherence fantasy is performed, and contradiction is transfigured into spectacle.

Through symbolic repetition, ritualised display, and affective saturation, the political becomes a theatre of jouissance—binding the subject to the enjoyment of fantasy.

In this libidinal theatre, belief is secondary; what matters is participation in the drama and its structuring inertia.

The subject remains loyal to the pleasure of coherence—even as it necessarily collapses necessitating its repetition—ideological principles likely emerge out of this need.

Without libidinal theatre, mass political formations cannot endure.

The mass political subject—an incoherent aggregate of structurally split individuals—cannot recognise itself without a shared fantasy.

This fantasy must be staged: ritualised through spectacle, stabilised by fetish, and saturated with jouissance.

The mass does not believe its coherence—it enjoys it.

It is this enjoyment that sutures the incoherent Aggregate into stable symbolic life.

Absent this theatre, the mass would disaggregate under the weight of its own contradiction.

### Axiom 2.4 — On Chaos Zones and the Staging of the Real

To stabilise its fantasy of coherence, every political order must labour to manufacture and sustain zones of chaos—sites where the Real is displaced, made visible, and ritually contained.

These chaos zones are not exceptions, but constitutive structural necessities.

They allow the mass to invest libidinally in the fantasy that order exists. Ironically it is through the chaos zone that the political defends against the unmediated overflow of the Real.

The more incoherent the centre becomes, the more chaotic the periphery must be made to appear.

Interventions into these zones are not solutions—they are symbolic rituals designed to reaffirm the fantasy.

Without zones of chaos, the Symbolic order would be forced to confront its own lack directly—and would collapse.

### Supplement — On the Aggregate as the Mask of the Political Subject

The political subject, as it appears in symbolic discourse, is not a unified subject of enunciation but a mask worn by the many. It is a symbolic fiction composed of structurally split individuals—each positioned differently within language, power, and fantasy.

This aggregate does not coherently desire, speak, or act. Its unity is retroactively imposed by fantasy, structured through fetish, and sustained by libidinal theatre. The political subject, in this sense, is not an agent, but the name of a misrecognised multitude.

The fantasy of a single political subject is necessary for coherence but impossible in structure. This is why mass politics must rely on spectacle—to give emotional and symbolic consistency to what cannot exist without it.

In Lacanian terms, this is the shift from $ (the barred subject) to Ɐ (the masked aggregate)—a movement from individual division to collective misrecognition. Psychopolitical Symbolics begins precisely here: where the fantasy of One conceals the Real of the Many.

## Axiom 3 — The Master Signifier and the Fantasy of Fixity

The master signifier (S₁) is not a sovereign anchor, but a symbolic node whose apparent fixity is sustained by fantasy.

S₁ attempts to halt the sliding of meaning and impose coherence upon the Symbolic.

This function is structurally impossible—hence, S₁ must be libidinally defended through fantasy, projection, and symbolic policing.

The libidinal requirement for defence arises precisely from this impossible task.

---

## Axiom 4 — The Fantasmatic Construction of the Other

### Axiom 4.1 — The Fantasmatic Construction of the Other

Blackness and the Other do not signify themselves in themselves—they drift.

They are dynamically structured in relation to the master signifier (S₁) as lack, excess, or opacity, depending on the fantasmatic demands of the Symbolic field.

These positions are received and imposed fantasies—signifying functions inherited through libidinal projections that displace the Real from the dominant subject.

Within the Symbolic order, these positions are capable of resignification through refusal and symbolic recomposition.

Yet every act of resignification risks carceral re-binding—where new meaning becomes a new form of governance, visibility, and discipline.

Liberation therefore requires not only resignification, but the preservation of opacity, the ethics of refusal, and the destabilisation of the Symbolic's demand to know.

### Axiom 4.2 — On Variegated Carceral Subjugation and the Biological Fantasy of the Real

The Fantasy Political Order sustains coherence through variegated carceral subjugation: racialised, civilisational roles imposed by biologised fantasy to manage the Real of human relationality.

These roles are not expressive—they are instrumentalised libidinal functions:

Blackness is cast as the rhythmic body, the vessel of affect and vitality, extracted and offered as the scene of enjoyment, yet denied coherence and independent material sovereignty.

Whiteness is formed through symbolic lack—a castrative architecture that converts absence into pulsion, driving accumulation, control, and abstraction. Creating a creature of compulsive Gestell: Storing up the world to release it as anxiety deferral; Consuming the world and self to displace structural lack.

Asianness, often read as machinic opacity—a repository of intelligence and inventiveness—is reduced to a non-vital functionality: hyperlegible yet affectively evacuated. Independent material sovereignty is permitted, yet mobilised to manufacture Asianness as existential threat, enabling a repeating carceral drama of suspicion, containment, and control.

Indigeneity becomes fossilised origin, temporally and materially exiled, rendered into symbolic nostalgia or vanishing authenticity.

Each of these positions is maintained by the fantasy that fantasmatic biology is destiny—a fantasy that binds the subject to a libidinal function that stabilises the contradictory incoherence of the aggregate political order.

This is not simply a symbolic lie—it is an imaginary regime of enforcement, operating across institutions, aesthetics, and unconscious investments.

To resist it directly is to offer it new mutation opportunities—to become the next spectacle of opposition, absorbed and reshaped into utility.

Refusal cannot take place within the coordinates of the system.

To rupture this architecture, one must engage in:

Opacity as labour: the sovereign embrace of our inherent coherence and the refusal of coherence as legibility within the carceral symbolic architecture.

Overflow as method: allowing relationality and revelation to spill beyond the boundaries the system imposes.

Sabotage of the fantasy of usability: not by destruction, but by distraction, dispersion, and the quiet centring of the inassimilable.

The Real cannot be managed. But space can be held open as labour for its entrance—through relation that does not bind, and identity that does not solidify.

Liberation is not the demand to be seen, but the labour relationality that traces the revealed contours of the Real.

---

## Axiom 5 — Economic Power as Fantasmatic Mediation

Economic power is not the ground of reality, but a symbolic and libidinal mediation of the Real.

Economic structures—capitalism, socialism, feudalism—organise the field of power through fantasies of value, order, and productivity, all designed to manage the contradictions of life.

Because the Real cannot be fully symbolised, economy is never sufficient; it must be supplemented by other fantasmatic regimes (race, gender, civilisation, law).

Thus, economic relations are material condensations of symbolic arrangements, not their origin.

---

## Axiom 6 — Overflow as Symbolic Rupture

When a subject exceeds the carceral bounds of resignified fantasy, the Symbolic field cannot simply incorporate it.

It must reconfigure its very architecture of relation—the fantasies that organise visibility, coherence, and power.

In this overflow, a new grammar becomes possible: not through assimilation, but through the disruption of the field's fantasy logic and the inauguration of another way of relating, naming, and symbolising.

---

## Axiom 7 — AI as the Fantasmatic Enforcement of Symbolic Coherence

The political imaginary, unable to contain the Real of life, turns to technological apparatuses to stabilise its symbolic field.

Artificial intelligence functions as a fantasmatic enforcer—automating the logics of coherence, exclusion, and control.

Far from transcending human bias, AI re-inscribes the Symbolic's inherited fantasies and violently precludes the emergence of the unspeakable, the opaque, and the truly new.

### Axiom 8 — The Enframing of Life as Data (Gestell and the Fantasy of Total Symbolic Capture)

In the technological age, the political imaginary imagines that life may be captured as data—ordered, stored, rendered accessible.

This is the fantasy of Gestell: the world—and Being itself—revealed not as mystery, or relation, or opacity, but as standing-reserve, a database of extractable, optimisable fragments.

The AI paradigm does not merely compute—it metaphysically forecloses.

---

## Axiom 9 — The Traversal of Absolutism

The Symbolic order is never complete, though it presents itself as absolute.

Theological-ideological structures sustain themselves by fantasy—projecting coherence, imposing closure, and foreclosing contradiction.

These structures position the subject within inherited relational imaginaries, demanding submission to a totalising grammar of being.

But the subject may traverse the inherited fantasy, disinherit its position, and refuse the demand for finality.

In this refusal, new symbolic life becomes possible—not as universality, but as poiesis: the creation of living grammars, relational truths, and ethical opacity beyond capture.

---

## Axiom 10 — The Fantasy of the Master Subject

The Symbolic order does not only require a Master Signifier (S₁), but is anchored by a Master Subject (S̅)—a phantasmatic position that infers, from the prevailing fantasy of order, the right to speak, name, observe, and remain coherent.

This subject-position is not a person, but a universalising fiction that disavows its own division by projecting incoherence onto others.

It is the invisible centre of epistemic legitimacy, moral vision, and political grammar.

To disinherit symbolic foreclosure, one must not only refuse S₁, but de-centre the Master Subject itself—exposing its incoherence and reclaiming the right to drift, speak, and symbolise otherwise.

---

## Axiom 11 — The Real Beyond Trauma

The Real is not reducible to trauma.

Though often encountered through rupture, excess, or contradiction, the Real also appears in non-traumatic modes: opacity, silence, resonance, drift, joy, and poetic coherence.

Psychopolitics must centre modes of encounter to reflect life's spectrum, not privilege suffering as the only site of symbolic recomposition as the legacy of Lacanian emergence as a method of clinical intervention, often centres.

Liberation may emerge not only from disintegration, but from the soft undoing of symbolic foreclosure, from relation that refuses injury as its ground, reflecting the fullness of life.

### Symbolic Algebra of Recomposition

The symbolic order does not recombine cleanly after collapse. Rather, following the collapse of an original Master Signifier (S₁), the symbolic field fragments (Sₓ), forcing a recomposition. This recomposition—S₂—is never pure. It emerges as a hybrid of what is admissible from the old and what is innovated under the pressure of symbolic breakdown:

```
S₁ ⟶ Sₓ ⟶ {S₁ᵃ, S₁ʳ} ⟶ S₂ = S₁ᵃ + Δ(Sₓ)
```

Where:

S₁ᵃ = the fragments of the old S₁ that are symbolically admissible and re-integrated.

S₁ʳ = the repressed, disavowed, or foreclosed elements of the old order.

Δ(Sₓ) = the symbolic innovations forced into emergence by the unbearable Real of symbolic collapse.

S₂ is thus a recomposed symbolic grammar, structured by selection, exclusion, and creative necessity. It stabilises not by restoring the old, but by inventing what can endure.

## Epilogue — Enter the Theatre at Your Peril

The beginning is always dreamt, and until it is dreamt it cannot exist and what is dreamt will not exist. Dreaming and what we build will disappoint, break, fall short and exceed. What we do undoes us and what undoes us makes us.

All dreaming is built in the symbolic. Our institutions and technologies are imaginations. Our identities enslave us to desires. They enslave us to theatre, and scripts written in our symbolic grammar bind us to the illusion of inevitability. The political will leave you politically bound and within it you cannot be free, but must perform the liberative labour as Sisyphus rolls the rock.

The political is the palimpsest of fools and wise men, saints and scoundrels, philanthropists and thieves. Enter its theatre at your peril.
